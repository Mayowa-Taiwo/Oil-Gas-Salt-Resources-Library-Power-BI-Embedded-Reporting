# Reporting Dashboard for Petroleum Well Data form Oil Gas Salt Resources Library
##Technical Case Study to Develop a Reporting Dashboard for Petroleum Well Data for Oil, Gas, Salt Resources Library using Power BI##

The primary objective of this case study is to showcase, through the application of best practices, the systematic process I would undertake to develop a comprehensive reporting dashboard for the Ontario Oil and Gas Regulator. By leveraging industry-leading methodologies, I aim to illustrate the step-by-step approach, from data collection and analysis to visualization design, ensuring the creation of an insightful and user-friendly dashboard that meets the specific needs of the regulatory body. 
This case study will highlight the strategic considerations, technical expertise, and attention to user requirements that are integral to the successful development of a reporting dashboard tailored to the unique context of Ontario's Oil and Gas regulatory environment.
